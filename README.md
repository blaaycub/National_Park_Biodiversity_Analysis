# National_Park_Biodiversity_Analysis

**Project Overview**

A data analysis on the conservation of endangered National Park species to try to identify patterns or themes in how these species become endangered.


### **Project Goals:**

The perspective of this project will be of a biodiversity analyst for the National Park Service. Their employer, the National Park Service, wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species in order to maintain the level of existing biodiversity within their parks. The main objectives of this analyst will be to gain an understanding of characteristcs about the species and their conservation statuses, and those species and their relationship to the national parks. 

* **Questions to gain insight**
    * What is the distribution of conservation status for animals?
    * Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
    * Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
    * Which species were spotted the most at each park?

### Data

This project has two data sets that came with the package. The first csv file has information about each species and another has observations of species with park locations. This data will be used to analyze the goals of the project. Note: The data for this project is *inspired* by real data, but is mostly fictional. Both Observations.csv and Species_info.csv was provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com).


### Analysis

In this section, descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will also be used to test if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include: 

1. Distributions
1. Counts
1. Relationship between species
1. Conservation status of species
1. Observations of species in parks
