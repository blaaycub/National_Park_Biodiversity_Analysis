# National_Park_Biodiversity_Analysis

**Project Overview**
A data analysis on the conservation of endangered National Park species to try to identify patterns or themes in how these species become endangered.



Results Summary
=======================
* There is a linear assocation of .343 between GDP and Life Expectancy. Generally, a correlation larger than about .3 indicates a linear association. A correlation greater than about .6 suggestions a strong linear association.

**Additional Findings:**

* The United States of America's GDP was 75.73% larger in 2015, relative to what it was in 2000.

* China's GDP was 813.42% larger in 2015, relative to what it was in 2000.

* The entire dataset has life expectancy median of 76.65 and a mean GDP of 3,880,498,570,768.39

* Between 2000 and 2015, Zimbabwe's life expectancy rate increased by: 31.96%, while the country's GDP was 143.72% larger in 2015, relative to what it was in 2000.

* Between 2000 and 2015, life expectancies in The United States of America, Mexico, Germany, China, and Chile increased at a combined average rate of: 4.38%.

Process
=======================


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
 * Establish the question(s) we are trying to solve
 * What kind of data do we have? What types of visualizations suit our types?
 * What's missing from the data? (if anything)
 * Where are the outliers?
 * How can we add, change or remove features to get more out of the data?

**Questions Formulated From EDA**

 * Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
 * Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
 * What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
 * Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
